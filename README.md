# Transmission_Delay_Simulation_Java

This project requires to implement a simulator (interactive animator) along with web interface to illustrates one of the most fundamental concepts in computer networking: transmission delay versus propagation delay.

The following figure shows the web interface which is an initial state:

As a part of implementation, we need to set up a web page for a GUI to simulate transmission delay versus propagation delay. The web page must show the first figure on the previous page to set the length between sender and receiver, transmission rate, and packet size and start simulation as well as to reset the simulation.

For example: A red bar shows the movement of packet over the link.
